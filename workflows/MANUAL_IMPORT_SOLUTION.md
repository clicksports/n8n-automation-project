# Manual Workflow Import Solution

## Current Status: Workflow Still Empty ❌

The user is correct - despite our import attempts, the workflow remains empty due to database permission restrictions.

## Immediate Solution Steps

### Step 1: Copy Workflow Content
The workflow content is ready in [`shopware-to-qdrant-import-fixed.json`](workflows/shopware-to-qdrant-import-fixed.json)

### Step 2: Manual Import via n8n UI
1. **Access the workflow**: Already open at `http://localhost:5678/workflow/65R674y1UCzx32mi`
2. **Use Import from JSON**: 
   - Click the menu (⋮) → "Import from JSON"
   - Copy the entire content from the JSON file
   - Paste and import

### Step 3: Alternative - Direct Database Fix
```bash
# Check n8n database location
ls -la ~/.n8n/database.sqlite

# Fix permissions (if you have admin access)
sudo chmod 664 ~/.n8n/database.sqlite
sudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.n8n/database.sqlite

# Restart n8n service
sudo systemctl restart n8n
# OR if running via npm
pkill -f n8n && npm start
```

## Quick Copy Command
```bash
# Copy the testing workflow to clipboard
cat workflows/shopware-to-qdrant-import-fixed.json | pbcopy
```

## Workflow Content Preview
The workflow contains these nodes:
1. Manual Trigger
2. Get OAuth Token (Shopware API)
3. Validate Token & Initialize
4. Fetch Products Page
5. Process Page & Check Pagination
6. Has More Pages? (conditional)
7. Transform Products for Vector Storage
8. Store in Qdrant Vector DB
9. Log Completion & Statistics

## Required Credentials Setup
Before testing, you'll need:
1. **Qdrant API credentials** - for vector storage
2. **OpenAI API key** - for embeddings
3. **Shopware API access** - already configured in workflow

## Testing Recommendation
Start with the "Fixed" version as it's limited to 2 pages for safe testing.
